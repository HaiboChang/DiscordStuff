We have chosen the Water Cube as the venue for this dinner because water has great symbolism in Chinese culture. Over 2,000 years ago, Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu noted that "The supreme good is like water, which benefits all of creation without trying to compete with it." True, water nourishes all things without them realizing it. We, APEC member economies, are brought together by the water of the Pacific Ocean. We have a shared responsibility to make the Pacific an ocean of peace, friendship and cooperation, an ocean that brings peace, development, prosperity and progress to the Asia-Pacific region. Tonight is an occasion of great significance. We meet here with the common purpose of sustaining the dynamic development of our region. We should use the APEC meeting as an opportunity to outline a long-term vision for the Asia-Pacific and chart the course for cooperation in our region. Tomorrow, we will meet by Yanqi Lake at the foot of Yanshan Mountains to kick off this year's APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. Confucius, another ancient Chinese philosopher, observed that "The visionary find joy in water and the wise find joy in mountains." Our meeting-place tomorrow has both water and mountain. I hope you will all share your vision and wisdom on the future development of the Asia-Pacific and the prospects of our cooperation.
